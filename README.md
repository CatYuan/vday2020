# vday2020
This is a website for Valentine's Day 2020.

## Coding Language and Libraries
It is originally coded in pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript, as these are the web tools that I am most familiar with.

I may refactor the website using the React framework in the future for ease of readability and to aid future development.

## A note on style
In `script.js` coding style is sub-par. I have left magic numbers in the code, among other things that are bad coding style. For the moment, I will leave these in the code, because this is a prototype. If I choose to expand on the website, one of the first things that needs to be done is fix these style errors.

## Possible Additions
Add smooth scroll on radio button click.
